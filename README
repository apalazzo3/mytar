We were close to finishing the c flag for our mytar file, but we spent several
hours stuck on the uid field of the header. The given functions in the spec
didn't give us the correct uid, and we were unable to write a workaround. 
We will continue to work on this after the deadline if possible once we
ask for help in office hours on Wednesday (23rd).
